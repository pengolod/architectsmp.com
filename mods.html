                    <h5 class="accordion icon solid fa-chevron-right" >&nbsp; How to: Shopkeepers</h5>
										<div class="panel">
											<p>You can use shopkeepers to sell your items, like Villagers with professions or Wandering Traders do.<br>
                        But you could also use these villagers or mobs as decoration without AI around your builds.</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>With the egg in your hand, left and right click in the air to select Shop Type.</li>
                      </ul>
                        <p>Selling shop sells items to players in exchange for diamonds.<br>
                        Buying shop buys items from players in exchange for diamonds.<br>
                        Trading shop will allow you to set your own currency / trade for other blocks and items (We recommend this one!).<br>
                        Book shop allows you to sell copies of signed books.</p>
                                            
                      <ul>
                        <li>Shift-right click to select the type of mob you want your Shopkeeper to look like.</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>AI is turned off, so your Shopkeeper won't wander off or get killed.<br>
                        You can get a certain look, color or size for a mob or villager later after placing it.</p>

                      <ul>
                        <li>Place your chest or barrel wherever you want it.</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>Just make sure to have a transparent block or air on top if you want to use a double chest.<br>
                        It can be anywhere in your shop as long as it is within 10 blocks of your Shopkeeper.<br>
                        You can even hide the chest, the contents can be accessed straight through your Shopkeeper.</p>

                      <ul>
                        <li>Right-click on the container you just placed down to link it to your Shopkeeper Spawn Egg.</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>Then right-click on the spot you want your Shopkeeper to stand.</p>

                      <ul>
                        <li>Shift + right-click on your shop to access the Shopkeeper Editor.</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>The top row in the menu will show the items your are selling, buying or trading.<br>
                        The second and third row are used for the currency (like diamonds).<br>
                        In the fourth row the paper shows you what type of shop you have selected.<br>
                        The left and right book allow you to go to the next or previous page if you're offering more than 9 items.<br>
                        On the bottom row the name tag allows you to name your shop.<br>
                        The chest on the bottom row in the menu allows you to access the container linked to your Shopkeeper.</p>

                      <ul>
                        <li>Place items in your container to see them appear in the top row after accessing the menu again.</li>
                        <p>Make sure you always leave at least one slot empty in your container to be able to receive payment!</p>
                      </ul>

                      <ul>
                        <li>Select the currency below the newly shown items in the menu.</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>Until you select the currency, the items will not show up in the Shopkeeper for other players.<br>
                        Left and right click both the item for sale and the currency to set the right amounts (like 1 stack for 3 diamonds).</p>  

                      <ul>
                        <li>You are able to change the look of some Shopkeepers by clicking on the other icons on the bottom row.</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>With Villager Shopkeepers you can even set the biome and profession.</p>  

                      <ul>
                        <li>The last slot in the menu shows a bone, which is used to delete your Shopkeeper.</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>Once an item of your stock runs out, other players will see it crossed out.<br>
                      The settings for currency and amounts will still be saved, you simply need to provide more stock.</p>  

                      <ul>
                        <li>You can collect your payment directly from the inventory of the container.</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>Or if you have a hidden container, via the chest icon in your Shopkeeper Menu.</p>   

                      <ul>
                        <li>If a diamond is too much currency to ask for what you are trying to sell, you can get 8 petrified oak slabs at the trader near the portal for 1 diamond.</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>For example, you can sell 1 stack of sand for 1 petrified oak slab. So the price would be equal to 8 stacks for 1 diamond.</p>
